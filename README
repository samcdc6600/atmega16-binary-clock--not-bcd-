We assemble simply by issuing the following command (where x.asm is the name of
our assembly file):
    avra x.asm
    
We flash our micro with the following command (this is assumming our flasher's
device file is ugen0.2 and hello.hex is the output of avra that we are
interested in):
   doas avrdude -p m16 -c usbasp -P/dev/ugen0.2 -U flash:w:hello.hex
